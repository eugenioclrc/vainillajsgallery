# vainilla-js-gallery
A short and light hackable gallery lightbox. In vainillaJS, write in ES6.
Transpiled by browserify.


Most ideas were taken from http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
I write my own lightbox gallery because i need a jquery free addon with
some custom event triggers.

Its not perfect, but ill do the work.
